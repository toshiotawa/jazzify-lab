# Diary Image Display Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds image upload and display functionality to the diary feature. Users can now upload images alongside their diary entries, and these images are displayed in the diary feed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
- **New Migration**: `20250718000001_add_image_url_to_practice_diaries.sql`
  - Added `image_url` TEXT column to `practice_diaries` table
  - Added descriptive comment for the new column

### 2. TypeScript Interfaces
- **Updated `Diary` interface** in `/src/platform/supabaseDiary.ts`:
  - Added `image_url?: string` field
  - Updated `fetchDiaries()` to include image_url in the response mapping
  - Updated `fetchUserDiaries()` to include image_url in queries and return type

### 3. Backend Functions
- **Updated `createDiary()` function**:
  - Added optional `imageUrl` parameter
  - Returns `diaryId` in response for proper image upload workflow
  - Modified database insertion to include image_url

- **Updated `updateDiary()` function**:
  - Added optional `imageUrl` parameter
  - Conditionally updates image_url if provided

### 4. Diary Store
- **Updated `DiaryActions` interface**:
  - Modified `add()` method to accept optional `imageUrl` parameter
  - Modified `update()` method to accept optional `imageUrl` parameter
  - Updated return type to include `diaryId`

### 5. DiaryEditor Component
- **Enhanced image upload workflow**:
  - Creates diary entry first (without image)
  - Uploads image using the actual diary ID
  - Updates diary record with image URL
  - Includes proper error handling for image upload failures
  - Clears image state after successful submission

### 6. DiaryFeed Component
- **Added image display**:
  - Renders images when `image_url` is present
  - Responsive image display with max-width and max-height constraints
  - Proper image styling with shadow and rounded corners

## Implementation Details

### Image Upload Workflow
1. User selects image → compressed and previewed locally
2. User submits diary → diary text is saved first
3. If image exists → upload image to Supabase storage with diary ID
4. Update diary record with image URL
5. Clear form and refresh feed

### Image Storage
- **Bucket**: `diary-images` (public bucket)
- **Path structure**: `{userId}/{diaryId}.{ext}`
- **Compression**: Images are compressed to WebP format, max 1MB
- **Original size limit**: 5MB

### Error Handling
- Image upload failures are handled gracefully
- Diary is still saved even if image upload fails
- User receives appropriate error messages

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Image Upload**:
   - Test with various image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
   - Test with images of different sizes
   - Verify compression works correctly

2. **Error Scenarios**:
   - Test with oversized images (>5MB)
   - Test with unsupported file formats
   - Test network failure during upload

3. **UI/UX**:
   - Verify image preview functionality
   - Test image removal before submission
   - Ensure images display correctly in feed

4. **Database**:
   - Verify image URLs are saved correctly
   - Test diary creation with and without images
   - Ensure proper cleanup of orphaned images

## Notes
- Images are stored in Supabase storage for reliability and CDN benefits
- The implementation supports premium/platinum plans as intended
- Image URLs are nullable to support existing diary entries without images
- The workflow ensures data consistency by creating diary first, then uploading image
