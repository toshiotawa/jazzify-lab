# Fantasy Mode Taiko UI Fixes

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Count-in measures treated as measure 1
- **Problem**: Count-in measures were being counted as the first question
- **Solution**: Added `countInMeasures` parameter to note generation functions to offset hitTime calculations

### Issue 2: Loop returns to count-in
- **Problem**: When looping, the music would return to the count-in measures
- **Solution**: Modified `handleTaikoModeInput` and `updateEnemyGauge` to wrap `currentNoteIndex` back to 0 when reaching the end

### Issue 3: Monsters and judgments reset at loop end
- **Problem**: At the end of the loop, monsters disappeared and judgments stopped
- **Solution**: 
  - Added loop handling in `handleTaikoModeInput` to continue processing
  - Added enemy gauge reset logic in `updateEnemyGauge` when music loops back
  - Used `lastMusicTimeRef` to detect when music time goes backwards

### Issue 4: Next loop's first measure not visible in advance
- **Problem**: When approaching the loop boundary, the next cycle's first measure wasn't pre-rendered
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `getVisibleNotes` to support `loopDuration` parameter
  - Modified time difference calculation to handle wrap-around at loop boundaries
  - Updated `FantasyGameScreen` to calculate loop duration and pass it to `getVisibleNotes`

## Technical Changes

### 1. TaikoNoteSystem.ts
- Added `countInMeasures` parameter to:
  - `generateBasicProgressionNotes()`
  - `parseChordProgressionData()`
- Added `loopDuration` parameter to `getVisibleNotes()`
- Implemented loop-aware time difference calculation

### 2. FantasyGameEngine.tsx
- Pass `countInMeasures` to note generation functions
- Added `lastMusicTimeRef` to track music time for loop detection
- Modified `handleTaikoModeInput` to loop back to index 0
- Modified `updateEnemyGauge` to:
  - Detect music loop (time going backwards)
  - Reset all monster gauges on loop
  - Handle note index wrapping

### 3. FantasyGameScreen.tsx
- Calculate loop duration based on stage parameters
- Use modulo operation on music time for consistent positioning
- Pass loop duration to `getVisibleNotes()` for proper visibility calculation

## Key Implementation Details

### Time Offset Calculation
```typescript
const offsetSec = countInMeasures * secPerMeasure;
const hitTime = offsetSec + (measure - 1) * secPerMeasure;
```

### Loop Detection
```typescript
if (currentMusicTime < lastMusicTimeRef.current) {
  // Loop detected - reset gauges
}
```

### Visible Notes with Loop Support
```typescript
if (loopDuration && loopDuration > 0) {
  if (timeUntilHit < -loopDuration / 2) {
    timeUntilHit += loopDuration;
  } else if (timeUntilHit > loopDuration / 2) {
    timeUntilHit -= loopDuration;
  }
}
```

## Testing Checklist
- ✓ Count-in measures are not presented as questions
- ✓ Loop jumps to measure 1, not count-in
- ✓ Monsters and judgments continue after loop
- ✓ Next cycle's first measure is pre-rendered at loop boundary
- ✓ Enemy gauges reset on each loop
- ✓ All ESLint rules and TypeScript strict mode compliant
